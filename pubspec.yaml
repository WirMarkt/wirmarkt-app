  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - fonts/
    - images/
    - images/menu/
    - config/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  #fonts:
  #  - family: Inter
  #    fonts:
  #      - asset: fonts/Inter-Regular.ttf
  #      - asset: fonts/Inter-Bold.ttf
  #        weight: 700
  #      - asset: fonts/Inter-Light.ttf
  #        weight: 100
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
